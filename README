DiffDir

ABOUT:

This application was written basically to make the process of server updates
easy when the code is being developed.

When the server is setup with first version of codebase, second version of
development will be continued. After the second version is released, you 
can use this application to compute the difference between the first version
and second version. 

The output will contain the changed files / new files that needs to be added
to your server to keep it up to date.

USAGE:
java pra.tools.dirdiff.core.BasicDiff fresh_copy old_copy [output_dir]

The computation of diff is described below in brief:
* First input is treated as fresh copy
* Second second is treated as old copy

* 1. If there are changes in files that exist in both the copies,
*    the file from first directory is copied to output directory.

* 2. If there is a new file in first directory it is added to output directory.

* 3. If there is a file in second directory but not in first directory,
* the file copy is ignored.

* 4. If output_dir is not specified then a folder by name output-<random-number> 
*    is created with respect to parent directory of old_copy directory.
